# Algo pipeline

Explanation goes here.

## Setup

The pipeline is implemented in python and can be installed using poetry.
To install poetry (OSX or Linux) run:

```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Then from the `./algo_model` directory run the command below to install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

Once installed you can run the multi-step pipeline, or run each step individually.

Running Scripts:

```bash
poetry run python main.py
```
```
```
